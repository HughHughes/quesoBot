No cheese, Gromit.
Gromit, that's it! Cheese! We'll go somewhere where there's cheese!
I don't know... it's like no cheese I've ever tasted...
No crackers, Gromit! We've forgotten the crackers!
No cheese, Gromit. Not a bit in the house.
Everybody knows the moon is made of cheese...
Cheese Gromit!
Oi, get off me cheese! Gromit! Gromit! Go for him! Gromit! I'll give you what for, you tyke! Gromit!
Gromit! There's a bomb in my pants!
Eh., these bank holidays, it's a problem to decide...
Well Gromit, let's see what's on the 9:05, shall we? Here she comes now. I wonder what this could be? Happy Birthday, chuck!
Nice walkies? How were the techno trousers?
As I say it's a bit dingy at present but it's surprising what a lick of paint'll do isn't it?
I think I'll make my own porridge.
I suppose you'll have to skip the country now. A fugitive, eh. You'll be hunted down like... well, a dog.
Where did you get that from?! That's my machine! I've got patent pending on that!
Get off me cheese! Get off!
Well I think we got away with that, eh pooch!
Oh, now that's just not cricket, Gromit! Anyone for tennis, perchance?
